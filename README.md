# Visual_C_redist_Installer
Quick installer for Visual C++ Runtimes V1


 This installer automatically installs the latest Visual C++ Runtimes
 available at the time this version of the installer was made.

 Runtimes included are the latest full Visual C++ Runtimes for Visual
 C++ versions 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015/2017. This includes
 both x86 and x64 runtimes. On 32-bit systems only the 32 bit runtimes
 are installed.
 
 Its written to be fast, and will be updated as soon as possible
 after new versions of C++ Runtimes are released.


 *****************************************************************
 Visual Studio 2017 'branded' runtimes have been built on the 2015
 runtimes and cover both 2015 and 2017 applications. 
 *****************************************************************

Before installation the script needs to remove existing Visual C++
 Runtimes.  You will be asked whether you want to proceed and
 uninstall existing Visual C++ Runtimes (recommended) or cancel and
 exit the installer. To proceed simply press Y (yes), which will
 automatically uninstall existing Runtimes and install those packaged
 included with this installer.

 This script can be used in 'auto mode' (no prompting) by typing
 'auto' after the script name, as an option.  This is useful
 for situations where you want it to be completely automated.
